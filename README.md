# Internetium-2-Source-Code
This is the source code of Internetium's latest version, which is a Internet Explorer fork. 

# Why I shouldn't use its pre-build executable
Yeah, I'd rather not it's executable is stolen. I removed the executables on the debug folder so you can't execute it. If you want to compile it, just build using Visual Studio.

# Is it open source?
Yeah, you can build your own browser like Internetium. Originally written for my friend Ranvir Singh, with some ideas. Like adding Escargot to toolbar, tabs.

# What browser it's based
It's based on Internet Explorer, based on WebBrowser built in control on VS. 


# What condition should I do?
You can use Visual Basic 2010 Express, but change the compile location.

# Can I contact you via Discord?
Yes, you can but if I busy, not. Username:basicallymachine_36262
